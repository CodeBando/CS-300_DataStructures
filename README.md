# CS-300_DataStructures
#### Summary
Develop a program that will load a data file into a specific data structure and display them in alphanumaric order

#### Problem to solve:
The client, ABCU, has requested a system to house their courses library for the computer science departmart by loading a data file that will be stored in a data structure that will allow them to print all of the available courses in alphanumaric order and search for a specific course that will display the course information to include the course number, course name and any prerequisite courses associated with it. The design problem to solve was to select the best data structure for the system that would execute at a reasonable speed to operate when loading, searching, and printing the course information. 

This effort was completed by developing Pseudocode for the system based on three different Data Structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree). Once completed, a Big-O analysis was done on the different data strutures before selecting one and building the system.

#### My approach:
When appraching this design system, I reviewed the plus-delta's of each of the three data structures, which can be found in the
